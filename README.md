# Brain_Tumor_Classification

Classifying brain tumors from MRI scans using Machine Learning requires a systematic approach, involving data preparation, model selection, training, and evaluation. 

--> Import Libraries: Include TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Scikit-learn.

-->Dataset: Utilize the MRI brain scans dataset divided into 'yes' (with tumors) and 'no' (without tumors). Due to its limited size, employ transfer learning.

-->Model Architecture: Incorporate convolutional and pooling layers, ReLU activation, and dropout layers to counteract overfitting.

-->Training & Evaluation: Conduct EDA, design a CNN using transfer learning, and measure its efficacy with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.

-->Testing: Deploy the model to determine the presence of brain tumors in MRI scans.

By following these steps, we can create a brain tumor detection model using machine learning techniques
